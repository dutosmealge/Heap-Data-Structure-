What it is:

This Java console application is a CUSTOMER SERVICE QUEUE using a Max Heap data structure.


What it can do:

This application manages customer service requests based on their priority.  It allows users to:
-	Add customer request
-	Process highest priority requests
-	Display the queue
-	Set queue capacity


Why I made this kind of application:

This application is a practical demonstration of a Max Heap and its application in real-world scenarios.  


How does it contribute to you or to the community:

In  Education it provides a clear and concise example of how to implement a Max Heap in Java. And by sharing this code, I contribute to the open-source community, providing a valuable resource for learning and practical application development. The code can be modified and extended for various purposes, fostering further learning and innovation. It helps others understand and use efficient data structures for their own projects.
